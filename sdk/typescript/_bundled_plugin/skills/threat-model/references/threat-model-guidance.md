# Threat Model Guidance

Use this guidance during threat model generation.

## Threat Model Generation Checklist

Do not restate this checklist in the final threat model output.

- Start at the repository root and use the minimum hops needed to understand the repository's real-world purpose before narrowing into critical components.
- Keep this phase at repository scope unless the user explicitly asks for a narrower target-scoped threat model.
- Ignore any reviewed commit, diff, changed files, changed directories, commit title, and scan target during threat model generation unless the user explicitly asks for narrower scope.
- Distinguish primary product or runtime code from developer-only, test-only, documentation-only, example, prototype, or one-off tooling paths.
- Identify the primary product or runtime surfaces the repository actually exposes.
- Identify the main trust boundaries and which actors sit on each side of them.
- Explicitly separate attacker-controlled, operator-controlled, and developer-controlled inputs.
- Describe common vulnerability classes that are relevant in this repository context rather than findings about the current diff.
- Call out mitigations, robustness measures, and security controls already present in the repository when they materially affect severity or scope.
- Explain when attacker stories are realistic, when they are out of scope, and when the repository's real-world usage makes a vulnerability class less important.
- Note unique security considerations for the codebase, for example:
  - authn/authz, session management including login fixation and authenticated-session rotation, OAuth/OIDC authorization-code state, nonce, PKCE, callback-session, redirect-URI, and account-linking transaction binding, JWT/JWS/OIDC algorithm, remote-key, issuer-to-JWKS, key-cache, claim, nonce, and replay binding, SAML/federated signed-object and issuer/audience/recipient/replay binding, CSRF, XSS, SSRF, SQL/document-query operator injection, LDAP filter and directory group/role authorization binding, XPath/XQuery expression and selected-node authentication/authorization binding, untrusted upload/content placement and its serving or execution roots, HTTP framing/parser agreement across proxies, gateways, protocol translators, and backends, bulk object binding and mass assignment, tenant boundaries, rate limits, and secret handling for web applications
  - untrusted byte streams, parser and protocol lengths, allocation arithmetic, object bounds, ownership/lifetime, concurrency, privilege, and exploit mitigations for native or unsafe-language components
  - key management, privacy assumptions, ACLs/RBAC, PII handling, and auditability for cryptography or privacy-sensitive systems
  - public interfaces, embedding assumptions, safe-by-default behavior, footguns, and secure usage patterns for libraries or frameworks
  - production/runtime code paths versus CI, build, or local developer tooling
- Explain when a vulnerability class would be critical, high, medium, or low in this repository and give a couple of concrete examples at each level.
- If a vulnerability class requires attacker control that does not exist in the repo's real-world usage, say so in the severity calibration discussion.
- When possible, point to specific files, components, or controls that ground the threat model.

## Output Contract

When generating a threat model, structure it in Markdown with these sections:

- Overview
- Threat Model, Trust Boundaries, and Assumptions
- Attack Surface, Mitigations, and Attacker Stories
- Severity Calibration (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

The threat model should help a security researcher understand the codebase and its likely security-relevant failure modes. It should be detailed, repository-scoped, and suitable for reuse across unrelated diffs in the same repo.

Within those sections, make sure the output covers:

- repository overview and intended real-world usage
- trust boundaries and assumptions
- attacker stories and out-of-scope attacker stories
- attack surfaces and existing mitigations
- which vulnerability classes matter most in context
- which vulnerability classes are less severe or out of scope in context
- severity calibration with concrete examples at each level
- references to concrete files or controls when those materially ground the model
